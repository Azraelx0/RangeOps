Once you have done this your script should reference the roster and course file to:
1. Pull the info from these files and create a pool for each student in the course; this will look something like this: *Course name*/students/*student name*-pool/
For each user in the roster file, you must:
2. Assign the user permissions to access their new pool
3. Clone the template listed in the class file as a linked clone, rename it to the students name, and add the VM to the user's respective pool. You should also place all vms for this assignment on the "intern-net" bridge.
If all goes well, then you should have a couple new pools on the nitrogen host with your *class name/students/student name-pool*, and in each of these pools will be the cloned VM of the template from your yaml file. These vms will all get DHCP addresses from the Intern-fw VyOS gateway!
