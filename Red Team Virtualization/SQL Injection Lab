# This lab will detail creating and exploiting an environment with an intentionally vulnerable SQL database.
# Scope: Kali VM as attacking machine. Ubuntu Server hosting vulnerable webpage and SQL database.
# Network: Both machines on Internal LAN receiving internet from VyOS firewall. 
# Tools/dependencies needed; attacker - sqlmap, webserver - apache2 php mariadb-server php-mysql libapache2-mod-php
## Different pages with vulns:
    index.php – basic home page
    db_connect.php – insecure database connection file
    search.php – vulnerable search form
    login.php – login form with insecure SQL
    register.php – registration form with raw SQL
    admin.php – displays user data with injectable filtering

# To begin with we will install both Kali and Ubuntu Server in our proxmox environment
Install dependencies on ubuntu
  sudo apt install apache2 php mariadb-server php-mysql
Create php webpages (see folder PHP for SQL Lab)
  - index.php
  - db_connect.php
  - search.php
  - login.php
  - register.php
  - admin.php
For our purposes we went with simply putting these files directly into the /var/www/html directory.
